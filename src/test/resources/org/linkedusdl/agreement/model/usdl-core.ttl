Any composite implementation of a service that is internal is invisible to consumers and not captured by the specification.

An InteractionPoint can be initiated by the consumer or the provider. Since InteractionPoints may take time and have an ordering with respect to other InteractionPoints, this is a subclass of TimeSpanningEntity.
One can therefore express temporal relationships between InteractionPoints such as before or after. For richer expressions the time ontology constructs could be used.</p>"""@en  .
